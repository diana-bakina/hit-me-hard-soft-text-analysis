[Verse 1]
To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change (Yup), you could borrow (Borrow)
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow

[Chorus]
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?

[Refrain]
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Me

[Verse 2]
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?
[Bridge]
I don't, I don't know why I called
I don't know you at all
I don't know you
Not at all
I don't, I don't know why I called
I don't know you at all
I don't know you

[Refrain]
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me

[Interlude]
And that's when you found me

[Verse 3]
I was waitin' in the garden
Contemplatin', beg your pardon
But there's a part of me that recognizes you
Do you feel it too?
When you told me it was serious
Were you serious? Mm
They told me they were only curious
Now it's serious, mm
[Chorus]
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?

[Post-Chorus]
Wringing my hands in my lap
And they tell me it's all been a trap
And you don't know if you'll make it back
I said, "No, don't say that"

[Outro]
(Wringing my hands in my lap)
(And you tell me it's all been a trap)
(And you don't know if you'll make it back)
(But I said, "No, don't say that")
(Wringing my hands in my lap)
(Tell me it's all been a trap)
(Don't know if you'll make it back)
(Don't say that)
Hm-hm
