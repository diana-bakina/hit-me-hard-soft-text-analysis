[Intro]
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
I fell in love for the first time
With a friend, it's a good sign
Feelin' off when I feel fine
Twenty-one took a lifetime
People say I look happy
Just because I got skinny
But the old me is still me and maybe the real me
And I think she's pretty

[Chorus]
And I still cry
Cry
And you know why

[Verse 2]
Am I acting my age now?
Am I already on the way out?
When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage
I'm a dog in a dog pound
And you said I was your secret
And you didn't get to keep it
And the internet is hungry for the meanest kind of funny
And somebody's gotta feed it
[Chorus]
Oh, do you still cry?
Still cry
Cry

[Bridge]
I nеver did you wrong (Never did you wrong)
And my (Oh), my patiеnce is gone (Is gone)
And I (I), I never did you wrong (You)
I, I loved you for so long (Hmm)

[Instrumental Outro]
