[Verse 1]
I'm trying my best
To keep you satisfied
Let you get your rest
While I stayed up all night

[Pre-Chorus]
And you don't wanna know
How alone I've been
Let you come and go
Whatever state I'm in, ah

[Chorus]
Man, am I the greatest?
My congratulations
All my love and patience
All my admiration
All the times I waited
For you to want me naked
Made it all look painless
Man, am I the greatest?

[Post-Chorus]
Hm
Oh-oh, hm
[Verse 2]
Doing what's right
Without a reward
And we don't have to fight
When it's not worth fighting for (Fighting for), mm

[Pre-Chorus]
And you don't wanna know (Know)
What I would've done (Done), hm
Anything at all
Worse than anyone
Mm, ooh

[Chorus]
Man, am I the greatest? (Greatest)
My congratulations (Congratulations)
All my love and patience
All my admiration (Admiration)
All the times I waited (Waited)
For you to want me naked (Naked)
I made it all look painless
Man, am I the greatest?

[Bridge]
The greatest
The greatest, ah-oh
I, I
I loved you
And I still do
Just wanted passion from you
Just wanted what I gave you
I waited
And waited (Oh)
[Outro]
Man, am I the greatest?
God, I hate it
All my love and patience
Unappreciated
You said your heart was jaded
You couldn't even break it
I shouldn't have to say it
You could've been the greatest
